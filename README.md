# notionhooks
A custom Notion integration that initializes a new Notion parent page and develops that directory as the project grows. 
Set Up Notion Integration:

Create a new integration in Notion and get the integration token.
Share the necessary database/pages with the integration.
Enhance README.md Content:

Ensure the README.md has detailed information about the project and its core functionalities.
Create a Script for Automation:

Use a programming language (e.g., JavaScript with Node.js) to interact with both the GitHub API and the Notion API.
Set Up Webhooks for GitHub:

Configure GitHub webhooks to trigger the script whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
Here is a step-by-step guide with code examples:

1. Set Up Notion Integration
